# zookeepr
heroku deployment: https://salty-ridge-47245.herokuapp.com/

## Takeaways
* server written with node.js, express.js, and jest
* functions and paths were split into their own route files and folders in order to keep server.js clean
* adding another webpage/route functionality, such as zookeepers, required a lot of borrowed and refactored functions from the animal pages/routes
* if you can follow the path then it makes sense!
